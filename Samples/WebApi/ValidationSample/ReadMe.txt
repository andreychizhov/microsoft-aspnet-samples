ValidationSample
----------------

This sample illustrates how you can use validation attributes on your models in ASP.NET WebAPI
to validate the contents of the HTTP request. It demonstrates how to mark properties as required,
how to use both framework-defined and custom validation attributes to annotate your model, and 
how to return error responses for invalid model states.

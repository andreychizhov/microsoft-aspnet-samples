BranchingPipelines sample
----------------------

OWIN request processing pipelines do not need to be linear, they can be branched
to process requests in different ways.  This sample shows how to construct a
branching pipeline based on request paths or other request data such as headers.
These components are available in the Microsoft.Owin.Mapping nuget package.

This sample is provided as part of the ASP.NET Web Stack sample repository at
